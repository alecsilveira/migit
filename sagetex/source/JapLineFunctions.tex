\Large{\textbf{Japanese Line Functions (Amidakuji)}}
\end{center}
They're known as Amidakuji, Ghost Leg, Japanese Ladder Games, 
ladders, and maybe some other names, too. At the time I couldn't
find them on the internet and ended up calling them Japanese 
line functions. Whatever you decide to call it, to create one you'll
draw a finite number of vertical lines followed by 
a finite number of horizontal lines drawn according to these rules:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item A horizontal line starts at one vertical line and ends 
	at the next vertical line.
	\item Horizontal lines never connect the endpoints of the vertical lines.
\end{enumerate}
Finally label top the top and bottom of each vertical line with 
different letters or numbers.

The figure below gives an example made up of 4 vertical lines 
where the rules have been followed correctly and an example 
where the rules have been violated. The 3 errors are in red:
the horizontal line from $b$ to $d$ violates the first rule and 
the lines from $a$ to $b$ and $c$ to $d$ violate the second rule.

Movement is always on a line according to these rules.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Always move down unless it's possible to move on a line 
left or right.
  \item Moving left or right continues until the next vertical line
 at which point the movement must be down. 
\end{enumerate}
These well defined set of rules ensure that just one 
movement is possible: down, right, or left. 
The path of $a$ has been traced out in the diagram below.
You should confirm that $b$ goes to $c$, $c$ goes to $a$ and $d$
goes to $d$.
