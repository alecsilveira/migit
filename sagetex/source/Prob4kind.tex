\noindent Suppose $5$ cards are dealt from a standard deck of $52$ cards. Find
$P(4 \mbox{ of a kind})$.\\\\
\textbf{Solution:} Since order is not important and repetition of 
cards is not allowed, this is a problem that involves combinations and
the denominator is $\binom{52}{5}$. Now use the \FPC to determine the number
of ways to get $4$ of a kind. 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
Event & Outcomes & Example\\
\hline
$E_1:$ Choose the kind for $4$ of a kind & $\binom{13}{1}$ & Q \\
$E_2:$ Choose the specific cards for $4$ of a kind & $\binom{4}{4}$ & 
Q\,$\clubsuit$, Q\,$\spadesuit$, Q\,$\heartsuit$, Q\,$\diamondsuit$\\
$E_3:$ Choose the remaining card & $\binom{48}{1}$ & 
Q\,$\clubsuit$, Q\,$\spadesuit$, Q\,$\heartsuit$, Q\,$\diamondsuit$, 
$5\,\spadesuit$\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
By the \FPC there $\binom{13}{1}\binom{4}{4}\binom{48}{1}$ different
ways to choose $4$ of a kind. Therefore, $P(4 \mbox{ of a kind})=\frac{\binom{13}{1}\binom{4}{4}\binom{48}{1}}{\binom{52}{5}}=\frac{624}{2598960} \approx 0.0002400960$.\\\\
