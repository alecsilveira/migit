\noindent Suppose $5$ cards are dealt from a standard deck of $52$ cards. Find
$P(3 \mbox{ of a kind})$.\\\\
\textbf{Solution:} Since order is not important and repetition of 
cards is not allowed, this is a problem that involves combinations and
the denominator is $\binom{52}{5}$. To determine the numerator be aware
that $3$ of a kind does not include having another pair of cards along with 
the $3$ of a kind. Now use the \FPC to determine the numerator. 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
Event & Outcomes & Example\\
\hline
$E_1:$ Choose the kind for $3$ of a kind & $\binom{13}{1}$ & $9$ \\
$E_2:$ Choose $3$ specific cards for $3$ of a kind & $\binom{4}{3}$ & 
$9\,\clubsuit$, $9\,\heartsuit$, $9\,\diamondsuit$\\
$E_3:$ Choose $2$ other one of a kinds & $\binom{12}{2}$ & 
$9\,\clubsuit$, $9\,\heartsuit$, $9\,\diamondsuit$, J, $4$\\
$E_4:$ Choose the suit of the first one of a kind  & $\binom{4}{1}$ & 
$9\,\clubsuit$, $9\,\heartsuit$, $9\,\diamondsuit$, J\,$\heartsuit$, $4$\\
$E_5:$ Choose the suit of the second one of a kind & $\binom{4}{1}$ & 
$9\,\clubsuit$, $9\,\heartsuit$, $9\,\diamondsuit$, J\,$\heartsuit$, $4 \,\clubsuit$\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
By the \FPC there $\binom{13}{1}\binom{4}{3}\binom{12}{2}\binom{4}{1}\binom{4}{1}$  
different ways to choose $3$ of a kind. Therefore, $P(3 \mbox{ of a kind})=\frac{\binom{13}{1}\binom{4}{3}\binom{12}{2}\binom{4}{1}\binom{4}{1}}{\binom{52}{5}}=\frac{54912}{2598960} \approx 0.0211284514$.\\\\
